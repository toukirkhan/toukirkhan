I am Mohd Toukir Khan, and I'm creating vibrant communities across India while learning and contributing to open-source software for good. Most likely, you'll see me at a conference, hackathon, or meetups sporting a red hoodie with pride and a yellow backpack on my back representing the GitHub Campus Experts Program I am part of. I enjoy discussing open source and scaling communities to provide developers with better opportunities! 🚀
